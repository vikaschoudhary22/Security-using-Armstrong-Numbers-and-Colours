# Security-using-Armstrong-Numbers-and-Colours
This is a cascaded cryptography system is an implementation of an [IEEE paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5738822). Multiple 
updates like colour based mapping tables and mathematical formulaeâ€™s for increasing the 
efficiency from O(n square) to O(n) are applied to the ideas presented in the paper.
